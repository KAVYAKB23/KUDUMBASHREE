      <h3 className="heading">HISTORY</h3>
      <p className="notes">
        Kudumbashree means different things to different people. For some, it is
        the poverty eradication project of the State government of Kerala. Some
        others view it as an exclusive domain of women engaged in social work.
        Yet in some others, the term Kudumbashree evokes the image of the women
        in uniform who come to collect waste from their door steps. For several
        people, Kudumbashree is like a blessing; a God-send. It appears as food
        to the hungry, as medicine to the sick, as a helping hand to the ailing.
        Sections of men also see Kudumbashree as an unwanted platform that made
        women arrogant. There are politicians who think Kudumbashree as a
        channel to reach the poor; there are also politicians who see
        Kudumbashree as a hindrance to decision-making process. Certain others
        see it as a platform from where women enter politics. The poverty
        eradication mission is called Kudumbashree. In a village setting, a NHG
        is called Kudumbashree. The CDS is called Kudumbashree. CDS chairperson
        is referred to as Kudumbashree chairperson. Women believe that it is
        Kudumbashree that supplies nutrimix to Anganawadis. If all of these is
        Kudumbashree, then, what is its history? How did it evolve? What we are
        trying to understand is how Kudumbashree – the community network of
        women and the Mission that supports it – came into being. Tracing it
        would amount to placing it in context, and examining the experiments and
        experiences from which the idea called Kudumbashree evolved.

      <h3 className="heading">EVOLUTION OF THE KUDUMBASHREE IDEA</h3>
      <p className="notes">
        Set in the context of the People’s Plan Movement which was a state
        strategy for mass mobilisation for bottom-up planning in the wake of the
        decentralisation of powers, Kudumbashree has been an outcome of its
        specific context. From the perspective of a government programme,
        Kudumbashree was the extension of the CDS experiments in Alappuzha and
        Malappuram. At the same time, the CDS initiatives themselves had drawn
        lessons and strategies from the NABARD led initiative of SHG Bank
        Linkage Programme. As an idea, its base has been neighbourhood groups
        (NHGs); the NHG idea had its own history within the State’s civil
        society domain. The NHG idea stayed in contrast with the SHG concept
        that had been promoted in many countries as well as in several States of
        India. The NHGs here were to be forums for planning and development
        action too. The concept of such NHGs too has peculiar roots in Kerala’s
        development history. And the very concept of forming groups around
        neighbourhoods had been ingrained in traditional forms of community
        organisation in the state. In sum, the Kudumbashree idea appears to have
        evolved through the community mobilisation experiments in Alappuzha and
        Malappuram, also drawing in from the various civil society initiatives
        in community mobilisation for different purposes. The Kerala CDS model,
        as recognised widely, evolved from the Alappuzha and Malappuram
        experiments. However, these initiatives themselves were informed by the
        experiences of certain traditional community organisations and
        practices. As pointed out by Rajeev Sadanandan, who was the district
        collector at Malappuram during the experiment there, women in NHGs fixed
        2% interest rate on the credit availed from the groups based on their
        experience in traditional organisations. Eventually it was the
        decentralisation of powers to PRIs and the People’s Plan Campaign set
        the stage for Kudumbashree’s formation.
